It is HeadShots.fun's policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including across our website, https://headshots.fun/, and other sites we own and operate.

## Photos upload

To upload photos to this site, you must ensure that:
- They are of yourself
- You own the rights to them

We reserve the right to remove any photos that do not comply with these guidelines. We are not responsible for any harm that may result from uploading photos that do not meet these criteria.

The photos you upload will only be used for headshots production. They will be completely removed when you delete the studio or notify us to do so (in some cases, it may take several hours to take effect due to caching).
